# recipe_organizer

This is a web app created during my time at Coding Campus. It utilizes Django for the backend and AngularJS for the frontend. 
It is made with CRUD functionality in mind as you can Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete recipes. I am looking to add user authentication through Angular in the coming months.
